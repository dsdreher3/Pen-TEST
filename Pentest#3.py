"""
This python program is a brief introduction into conducting a penetration test. The
program was also created with the idea to be able to utilize the code in Capture the
Flag (CTF) scenerios.  The code begins by asking if the user would like to conduct a
penetration test. If the user inputs yes the code then prompts for their current
host address and subnetmask in the default format of 192.168.1.1/24.  The program
will take in the ip address and subnetmask as an object and add it to a dictionary.
Lastly the code will output a unique nmap terminal command that is specific to the
ip address and subnetmask inputed by the user.

"""
This penetration test tool can be expanded on in many ways to be more helpful to
the user.  I plan to expand this program by adding "help" functionalities that
will allow the user to strike a predefined key and give hints on where to find the
information to input into the code.  Ultimately, I would like my code to be able
to run itself with no input from the user along with any external scans needing to
be ran.  The code will also keep adding useful entries into the dictionary
(database) and be able to print the information as a readable log.
